# Hello! 👋

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=avattipalli)

I am a Test Engineer 🥷 who is passionate about test automation and building infrastructure around it. I've got experience with a variety of libraries and frameworks that can test a full stack application and provide insights into performance and it's stability.

- 🏃 I'm currently interested in building with playwright and/or codeceptjs
- 🐕‍🦺 I have experience with API test automation including GraphQL APIs apart from REST and SOAP
- ☎️ I have experience with setting up opentelemetry and instrumentation into applications and gain visibility into traces spanning across services
- 📋 I can create dashboards to monitor site performance and web vitals scores and catch regressions during releases
- 🏄 I help organizations to scale their test platforms starting from scratch catered to individual teams and domains

If I am not working, I enjoy solitude, reading or listening things related to health and financial markets. I am always ready to have deep insightful converstations or small talk on cars, crypto, movies and chess.
